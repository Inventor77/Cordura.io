# CORDURA

****TO BE SANE IN SPAIN, YOU'D SAY "CORDURA"****

## Inspiration

Due to the complexity of the disease and limited resources, mental health disorders are a real issue for both professionals and patients. Unfortunately, **COVID19** poses a significant challenge to mental healthcare, and demand for effective digital healthcare has peaked.

*Global Burden of Disease Study 1990â€“2017: One in seven Indians were affected by mental disorders of varying severity in 2017, and the proportional contribution of mental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost doubled since 1990. Globally, there are 450 million people who are affected by this. Moreover, the pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in the number of cases of mental illness. Also, according to the WHO, between 2012 and 2030, mental health conditions in India will cause an economic loss of 1.03 trillion dollars. **[[Resource]](https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/world-mental-health-day-2020-in-numbers-the-burden-of-mental-disorders-in-india-51627/)**

I was inspired by our reality because we all experience sadness, loneliness, depression, and lack of motivation... but we don't pay attention to the consequences. The thing is, our mental health is just as important as our physical health. I was inspired by my own situation; I've had a difficult year and initially thought it wasn't a big deal, but now I'm suffering from some memory problems, anxiety, tiredness and high blood pressure. And, as I see on social media, many people are going through the same thing but are unaware of the consequences.

Recently, people have been forced to confront the reality of death. Because we live in a culture of death denial, it's easier for us to ignore death, but we also ignore those who are dying.

## The problem we chose to tackle

Those who are nearing the end of their lives report feeling anxious, unprepared, and isolated. Logistical tasks are postponed until the last minute, and relationships are incomplete as loved ones avoid the dying. This is due to living in a death-denial culture as a result of industrialization and medical progress.

## Target audience

Those approaching the end of their lives, including chronically and/or terminally ill patients of all ages, as well as their family and friends
Positive psychological capacities of individuals are emphasized in the project rather than mental illness. Individuals and society as a whole will benefit from this focus, and mental health services will be relieved of some of their burden.

## What it does

**CORDURA** is a web app that allows users nearing the end of their lives to easily complete their logistical last steps, plan fun activities they want to do before passing, and invite loved ones to join them. It draws attention to the elephant in the room while also addressing the pervasive problem of loneliness and death anxiety.
